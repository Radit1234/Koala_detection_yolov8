# Koala_detection_yolov8
Description : Object detection is a major area of computer vision applications. For the task I had a set of images that contain instances of Koala. My main goal was  to preprocess the images and build a dataset, train an object detection model using the prepared dataset, and develop an API for getting inferences from the model.
## Data Annotation

 As it is a object detection project so we have to annotate those image so that our model can understand how the real Koala looks like. So for this parpose I used the www.cvat.ai .Using this website I markdown my object with leveling and later downloaded the files.
